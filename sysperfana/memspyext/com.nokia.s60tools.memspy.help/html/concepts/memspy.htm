<h2>MemSpy and MemSpy Launcher S60 applications</h2>
<p>The MemSpy S60 application tracks various subsystems that directly or indirectly contribute to overall system memory usage and provides information about the changes in these subsystems at specified time intervals.</p>
<p>The memory tracing functionality of MemSpy can be targeted at a specific thread to analyze the memory changes that occur during the life cycle of the thread.</p>
<p>The MemSpy Launcher S60 application listens to TraceCore for activation messages from the MemSpy Carbide.c++ Extension. After receiving an activation message, MemSpy Launcher commands MemSpy.</p>
