<h2>Understanding the Excel data</h2>
<p>Because reading and analyzing SWMT log files is difficult, SWMT Analyser tool can write the log file data to an Excel sheet in an appropriate manner so that you can easily understand and analyse the data.</p>
<p>Excel contains different worksheets to represent various data such as heap-chunks, non heap-chunks, RAM and disk memory, and total heap size.</p>

<p>The Excel tabs and the information displayed in them are explained in the following table.</p>

<table width="615" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2">
<colgroup>
<col width="149*">
<col width="456*"></colgroup>

<ul>
<li>Cycle numbers, that is, numbers of selected log files to export, Time Period and Time Duration.</li>
<li>Total delta of various fields like Heap Size, Free Cell Count, Allocated Cell Count, Free Space, Allocated Space, Slack   Space, Total files, and Total P&amp;S Handles for all the threads.</li>
<li>Status of each thread in the last cycle and delta of various attributes for each thread.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: Stack size will be displayed for all threads which are alive.</p>
