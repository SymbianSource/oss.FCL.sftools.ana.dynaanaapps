<h2>Prerequisites for use</h2>
<p>Before you start using MemSpy, check the following items:</p>

<p>If you are importing log files from a disk, there are no prerequisites.</p>
<p>If you are importing log files from a target device, check that you have a TraceCore connection from the target device to the PC.</p>

<p>The MemSpy connection to a target device uses the MemSpy Launcher application that runs in the background in the device. The Launcher application is delivered with the MemSpy Carbide.c++ Extension as an RnD signed SIS file that is located in the <i>plugins\com.nokia.s60tools.memspy.trace_X.Y.Z\Launcher.binaries</i> folder in the Carbide.c++ installation folder in which X.Y.Z is plugin version number.</p>

<p>In addition, note that USB tracing requires that you have a tracing application such as <b>TraceCoreUserApp</b> or <b>TraceSwitch</b> installed in your target device.</p>
