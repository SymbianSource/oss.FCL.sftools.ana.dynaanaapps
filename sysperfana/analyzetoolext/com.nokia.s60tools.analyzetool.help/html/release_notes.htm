<h3><a name="compissues"></a>Compatibility issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>AnalyzeTool iby files (ROM image creation) at S60 5.0 SDK and higher are not compatible with older than week 16/2009 release of SDK.</li>
	<li>Not compatible with older versions than 1.6.0 of AnalyzeTool command line engine.</li>
	<li>Kernel code analysis not supported.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="issues"></a>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Note:</b> If you are updating AnalyzeTool from the version older than 1.5.0, AnalyzeTool uses a different folder structure compared to previous versions. Therefore it is essential that you check that there are no header files in the folder <i>\epoc32\include\applications\analyzetool</i> or <i>\epoc32\include\analyzetool</i>.</li>
	<li>Tested processes must be closed successfully, meaning that they cannot be panicked or exited abnormally (will cause also a lot of false memory leaks).</li>
	<li>Handle leaks in subtest shows substraction of open handles within the subtest.</li>
	<li>The subtesting feature cannot be used with internal data gathering mode.</li>
	<li>Memory leaks from ECOM plugins are reported, but not pinpointed to code lines inside plugin.</li>
	<li>Pinpointing memory leaks from urel binaries shows only function names.</li>
</ul>
