<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>AnalyzeTool is a tool used for testing Symbian software for memory leaks and pinpointing the leaking problems in source code. AnalyzeTool is used from Windows command prompt or from Carbide.c++ 2.0 onwards. Using AnalyzeTool requires an S60 3.1, S60 3.2, or S60 5.0 device with R&amp;D certificates. Tracing utility Connection (USB) is required as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracing utility Connection (USB) is required for collecting real time data from target hardware to PC.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note!</b> You cannot use AnalyzeTool if you do not have access to source codes of a tested application. Testing is also limited to user side SW instead of kernel SW.</p>
<p>You can use the AnalyzeTool Carbide.c++ Extension for the whole test cycle or just to read the analysis file generated by the command line tool. AnalyzeTool supports automated testing without a need for any user interaction. AnalyzeTool works as a background service, so no user input is necessary during the test run. Analysis does not interfere with program run so it can be executed among any other testing activities.</p>
<p>Currently AnalyzeTool supports memory analysis on S60 based devices by storing all the reserved memory addresses that were never released. Memory addresses with call stack information are used for identifying the code line of the possible memory issue. AnalyzeTool can also spot unclosed resource handles at process exit, and in most cases it can pinpoint the exact code line where the memory issue was introduced.</p>

<h5>Basic workflow of AnalyzeTool</h5>
<img src="../images/AT1.png">
<ol>
<li>Tested software is first compiled with AnalyzeTool.</li>
<li>Software is installed to target hardware as well as the Symbian components of AnalyzeTool.</li>
<li>Data is collected to PC/target hardware while tests are run. Analysis is run after the test run is completed to spot memory issues.</li>
</ol>
