<h2>Running subtests</h2>
<p>You can run subtests which are tests inside a test run. While the test run life cycle is the same as for the tested process, the subtest is started and stopped inside the time frame of the test run. The number of test runs is not limited and they can overlap each other.</p>
<p>To run subtests:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When the data capture is running and you have started the test run, you can start a new subtest by selecting <b>Start subtest</b> from the <b>AnalyzeTool</b> view. The subtest name dialog is now displayed, and starting from this point AnalyzeTool collects separate memory leak data for the subtest timeframe.</p>
<p>When the subtest is started, the information is displayed in the message area. The information contains the target name and the subtest name.</p></li>
<li><p>When the desired subtests in the target device are run, the next step is to end the active subtest by selecting <b>Stop subtest</b> from the <b>AnalyzeTool</b> view.</p> <p>If there are multiple subtests running, the <b>Select subtest to stop</b> dialog is displayed.</p><p>Information of ended subtest is displayed in the message area.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the test run is finished, AnalyzeTool shows the data about subtests run under the test run.</p>
