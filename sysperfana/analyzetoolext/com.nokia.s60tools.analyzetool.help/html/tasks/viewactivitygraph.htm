<h2>Viewing memory activity graph</h2>
<p>Memory activity graphs are generated automatically after the data capturing is stopped. Alternatively, an existing trace file can be opened to view memory activity graphs. For more information, see <a href="..\concepts\datafile.htm">AnalyzeTool files</a>.</p>
<p>There are two options for opening a memory analysis data file:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the <b>Project pop-up</b> menu, select <b>AnalyzeTool</b> > <b>Open and analyze data file</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>AnalyzeTool</b> view, click the <b>Open and analyze data file</b> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Memory activity graphs are displayed in the <b>AnalyzeTool</b> window on the <b>Graph</b> tab. After the data has loaded, select a process in the <b>Process</b> drop down box to view its memory activity. </p>

<h3>Description of graph</h3>
<p>The graph shows the cumulative memory of the given process over time. 
Each memory operation is marked with a dot on the graph as follows:
<ul>
<li><font color="blue">Alloc</font>: A memory allocation is marked in blue if it is freed during the lifetime of the process.</li>
<li><font color="red">Leak</font>: A memory allocation is marked in red with a vertical line going down if it is not freed during the lifetime of the process (also known as <em>leak</em>).</li>
<li><font color="green">Free</font>: A memory free is marked in green.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hovering the mouse over a memory operation shows a tooltip with relevant information. 
A memory operation can also be selected with a mouse click. This will highlight the memory operation on the graph, and 
more detailed information is shown in the Eclipse Properties view. The Eclipse Properties view may include callstack information if available.
<p><b>Tip</b>: Use the <b>arrow left</b> and <b>arrow right</b> keys to move to the next or previous memory operation.</p> 
<p>When a memory operation is selected, related memory operations are highlighted on the graph. For example, when an alloc is selected, its associated free memory is marked on the graph with a green line going down.</p>

<h3>Navigating the graph</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Zoom in:</b> Select a region in the graph with your mouse (click the left edge and drag to the right edge of the region to be zoomed in).</li>
<li><b>Zoom out:</b> Right-click with the mouse.</li>
<li><b>Scroll:</b> Use the scroll bar. Alternatively, select a memory operation with your mouse and use the <b>arrow right</b> or <b>arrow left</b> keys to bring the next or previous into view.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Eclipse Properties View</h3>
<p>When a single memory allocation is selected on the graph, the Eclipse Properties view shows detailed information about the memory operation.
If the Eclipse Properties view is not already open, it can be opened by selecting <b>Windows</b> > <b>Show View</b> > <b>Properties</b>.

<p>Double-clicking an item in the callstack opens the appropriate source code file to that code line, provided the source code file can be found in the selected project in Carbide.c++.</p>
