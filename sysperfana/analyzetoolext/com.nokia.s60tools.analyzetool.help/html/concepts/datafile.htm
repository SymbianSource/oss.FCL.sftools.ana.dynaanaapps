<h2>AnalyzeTool files</h2>

<p>AnalyzeTool uses files as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device data file. Data file saved to target device in <b>output to file
    system</b> mode.</li>
  <li>Raw data file. Analysis file saved after the trace is captured in
    <b>output to trace</b> mode.</li>
  <li>Memory leak results. Results file saved by user.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these files can be opened by using the same button in
<b>AnalyzeTool</b> view. AnalyzeTool automatically recognizes the file type,
and performs the desired action.</p>

<h4>Saving analysis data</h4>

<p>You can save the memory leak results or raw test run data. The difference
between the file formats is that the raw test run data contains all available
data collected during the test run, whereas the memory leak results file only
contains the test results from the currently selected project. The memory leak
results file can be opened and the results read without source codes, but the
raw data always needs the source codes built with AnalyzeTool before it can be
opened.</p>
