ProcessorSpeedInputDialog_0=PI PEC: MIPS Graph Generation
ProcessorSpeedInputDialog_1=The performance counter trace contains data for MIPS graph generation but the processor speed is missing.\n\nPlease enter the hardware's processor speed in MHz manually if you wish to see a MIPS graph.
ProcessorSpeedInputDialog_3=Please enter a value or cancel.
ProcessorSpeedInputDialog_4=The value is out of range [%d, %d]
ProcessorSpeedInputDialog_5=The value has to be an integer number.
