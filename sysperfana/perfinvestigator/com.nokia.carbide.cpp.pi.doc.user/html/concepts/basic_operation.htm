<h2>Basic Operation</h2>
<p>The following Profiler information provides a view on how trace items have been put together to produce a functional combination of measurement software.</p>
<p><a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> gives an overview of the practical instrumentation in use within the Performance Investigator Tool. As shown, the low-level functionality has been encapsulated to a LDD (Logical Device Driver), which is able to perform under a supervisor mode with kernel privileges. In Figure 2, the data flow is represented by a dashed line, and the control flow with a solid line. Active elements that perform processing (processes and interrupts) are indicated in grey and passive elements (software components) in white.</p>
