<h3><a name="whatsNew" id="whatsNew"></a>What's New </h3>
<ul>

    graphics memory usage. Both private and shared graphics memory usage can be
    displayed in the graph.</li>
  <li><b>Performance Investigator Wizard </b>&mdash; Support for tracing
    Profiler data remotely from the device.</li>
  <li><b>Performance Investigator View </b>&mdash; Support for handling
    imported Profiler data files on the view.</li>

    thread load to the CPU Clock Speed.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="agent" id="agent"></a>Target Performance Investigator Profiler
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To produce a Profiler data file, you need to install one of these
    profiler agents: 
    <ul>
      <li><span class="code">Carbide Profiler 2.0 Installer</span> - for S60
        3.0 (3rd Edition, initial release) devices</li>
      <li><span class="code">Carbide Profiler 2.0 (Dual CPU) Installer </span>-
        for S60 3.1 (3rd Edition, Feature Pack 1) devices with dual CPUs, such
        as the N95 and N96</li>
      <li><span class="code">Carbide Profiler 2.0 (Single CPU)Installer</span>
        - for S60 3.1 (3rd Edition, Feature Pack 1) devices with a single CPU,
        such as the E71, N76, 6290, N78 and 5320 </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Those files and others can be can be downloaded and installed using the
    <b>On-Device Connections &gt; New Connection Wizard &gt;</b><a
    href="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.nokia.carbide.cpp.doc.user/html/reference/trk/wnd_new_connection_wizard.htm">Install

        menu item does not appear on the menu toolbar after an invalid format
        error occurs while opening an NPI file.</span></td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><p>Workaround: To show the Investigator
        menu item, give focus to any non-NPI file or to any view other than the
        editor view (e.g., to the Symbian Project Navigator view).</p>

        all traces enabled and using the maximum sample rates (50ms and 250ms)
        may cause Profiler to exhibit strange behaviors</p>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><p>Symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>S60 - You may get unusual errors such loss of icons in lists.</li>
          <li>UIQ 3.0 - The generated .dat file is corrupted and when imported
            into the Analyzer can cause a crash.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Workaround: Do not use maximum sampling rates, if all traces must be
        enabled, to avoid a high CPU overload condition. You can do this by
        either upping the time interval to 100ms/500ms or by disabling some
        traces.</p>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><p>The workaround is to allocate more
        memory in the Carbide.c++.ini file (typically in the Carbide.c++ folder
        that contains Carbide.c++.exe). For example, to allocate 1GB, edit the
        Carbide.c++.ini to contain &ldquo;-Xmx1024m&rdquo; and then restart
        Carbide.c++.</p>
