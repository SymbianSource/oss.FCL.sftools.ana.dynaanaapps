<h2>Using the Profiler</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>After successfully <a
href="../../tasks/profiler/prof_installation.htm">installing</a> the Profiler
.SISX file on your target device, you will be able to access the user
interface. Run the <b>CarbidePI</b> application located in the
&ldquo;Installed&rdquo; applications (Figure 1).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../profiler/images/SamplingProfilerMainWindow.png" ></p>
     


<p align="center" class="figure">Figure 1 - Profiler Main Window (S60) </p>

<p>In Options, configure the necessary run-time options. Specify which traces
you want enabled, where to place the generated .dat profiler data file, the
profiler file prefix, and the trace priority sampling interval.</p>

<p>In the Profiler, the Address/Thread trace is <strong>always</strong> active
when profiling is performed. Other traces are synchronized with the
Address/Thread trace.</p>

<p>In addition to Address/Thread trace, you can enable additional trace options
such as dynamic binary support, memory and power usage, and function calls.</p>

<div class="step">
<h4>Profiling an Application</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Profiler options screen 
    <p>Select the Tracing options menu from the Profiler menu (Figure 2) </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/TracingOptions.png"></p>
  </li>

  <p class="figure">Figure 2 - Tracing Options</p>
  <li>Enable or disable trace options</li>

  <p>Specify On or Off for the available trace items - Dynamic binary support,
  Function call capture, and Thread priority capture. (Figure 3).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left" class="note"><b>NOTE</b> If the executables you wish to
    analyze are not in a ROM image (.symbol file) of your target device, then
    you will need to turn on Dynamic binary support.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../profiler/images/TracingOptionsList2.png" ></p>
          

  <p align="center" class="figure">Figure 3 - List of Trace Items</p>
  <li>Specify Output</li>

  <p>Specify the output for the sampled data (Figure 4). The output method can
  be either the <span class="style1">File system</span> or <span
  class="style1">Debug port</span>. If you select File system, you can save the
  data file to a memory card or the target device C:\ drive. With the debug
  port output method, you will need hardware (such as the Nokia Musti box)
  connected to the XTI/STI debug port to capture the profiler data. There is
  less profiler overhead if the debug port is used.</p>
          <p align="center">
          <img src="../profiler/images/OutputOptionsWindow_FileSystem.png"
       ></p>
     


  <p align="center" class="figure">Figure 4 - Output Options</p>

  <p>You can specify the file prefix for data files. The name of the profiler
  data file is formed from the prefix plus stream.dat. If you perform multiple
  traces and use the file output option, include a hash mark (#) in your file
  prefix. Subsequent traces will then be saved with different file names. The
  hash mark is automatically replaced with a number. For example, if you define
  the file prefix as <span class="style1">PI_#_</span>, multiple trace files
  will be named <span class="style1">PI_1_STREAM.dat, PI_2_STREAM.dat, &hellip;
  PI_100_STREAM.dat</span>. Only one hash mark is needed to provide sequential
  numbering. If no hash mark is present, the same file will be overwritten with
  the same name.</p>

  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong> Currently, files names should be 19
  characters or less.</p>
  <li>Specify Advanced Options</li>

  <p>In Advanced options, specify the thread priority sample interval (Figure
  5). The operating system is called automatically every millisecond to
  determine what thread is currently executing. This interval setting indicates
  how often an additional query to the operating system is made to determine
  the priority of the currently executing thread. The interval is specified in
  milliseconds. The default is 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds). You can get a
  thread priority as often as you like but be aware that frequent sampling of
  the OS may skew the performance measurement while making the call. There is a
  significant overhead to obtaining the priorities of all threads.</p>

  <p>You can choose an address/thread sampling interval between 1ms and 10000ms
  (10 seconds). For intervals greater than 1 ms, memory, power, priority and
  button events are sampled periodically; not every millisecond. Memory and
  button events are individual events. For memory and priority the current
  memory size and priority are recorded before entering the time interval, then
  changes during the interval are recorded and the final memory size and
  priority when it exits the interval is recorded.</p>

  <li>Profile your application</li>

  <p>After establishing your desired options, select <strong>Options &gt;
  Profiler &gt; Start</strong> from the main window (Figure 6) to begin
  sampling.The state will change from "Initializing" to "Sampling" and then
  "Finished". When the state has changed to &ldquo;Profiling&rdquo; or
  "Sampling", the trace activity has begun. Note that none of the
  configurations can be changed when the tracing is active.</p>

  <p class="note"><b>IMPORTANT!</b> After the trace activity has started, leave
  the Profiler running in the background. Now you can proceed with the use case
  you wish to analyze. For example, run your application on the device.</p>

  <p align="center" class="figure">Figure 6 - Starting a trace session </p>

  <p>Stop the trace activity by switching back to the profiler and selecting
  <strong>Options &gt; Profiler &gt; Stop</strong>. Do not use the profiler
  while the trace data is being written to the data file. When the profiler is
  stopped, the profiler state shown in the main window will change from
  &ldquo;profiling&rdquo; to &ldquo;stopping profiler&rdquo;, and finally back
  to &ldquo;ready&rdquo;. The profiler data file is automatically written to
  the output previously selected. The actual amount of produced data depends on
  the length of time tracing was active and which trace options were selected.
  The Address/Thread trace alone produces approximately 1-4 Kbytes / second.
  Transfer the data file to your workstation to be analyzed with the
  analyzer.</p>
