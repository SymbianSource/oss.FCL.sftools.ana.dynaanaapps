<h2>Profiler</h2>
<p>The profiler is the part of the Performance Investigator that resides on the target device. Its purpose is to gather performance measurement information from the device at run-time and to output the information to be analyzed within the Analyzer part of the tool. Each type of performance information recorded is called a trace. The most important Profiler traces include:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Address / thread trace periodically records the current program counter address and the currently executing thread.</li>
  <li>Dynamic binary support trace periodically records information sufficient to determine which dynamically loaded user application or DLL is executing.</li>
  <li>Function call trace periodically records the link register value, so that the caller of the currently executing routine can be determined.</li>
</ol>
