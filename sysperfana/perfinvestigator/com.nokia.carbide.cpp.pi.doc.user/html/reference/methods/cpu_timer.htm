<h3>CPU Timer</h3>
<p> If available, free CPU timers can be
			used to calculate time spent within activities whose performance
			Related references is required. For example, in OMAP1510/ARM925T
			architecture, there are three freely usable CPU timers that can
			count with frequencies up to the CPU main clock frequency, therefore
			accurately recording temporal activities.
			The disadvantage in using CPU timers in performance measurements
			is that in most cases the timers have already been employed
			by other activities. Through investigation of those activities it
is still possible to use the CPU timers in harmony with them, but with certain limitations.</p>
