<h3>Saved Program Status Register</h3>
<p> In ARM architecture, the saved
			program status register (SPSR) is a banked register in all of the
			exception modes (thus not in user mode or system mode). When
			switching the processor mode from any other mode to any of the
			exception modes, the value within the CPSR is stored to the SPSR
			so that it can be recovered after the exception (such as an
			interrupt) has been processed. When having performance measurement
			instrumentation within an interrupt, it can be useful to
			investigate the value within the SPSR in order to find out the
mode of the processor before the interrupt.</p>
