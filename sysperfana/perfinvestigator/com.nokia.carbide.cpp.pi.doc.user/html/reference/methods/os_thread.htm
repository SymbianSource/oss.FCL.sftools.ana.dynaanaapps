<h3>OS Thread Name and ID </h3>
<p>In interrupt processing or kernel executable in a privileged mode and within the kernel process, it is possible to efficiently resolve the name and the thread ID of the currently executing thread. Accordingly, it is possible to resolve the average execution time distribution between different threads in a periodic interrupt. This takes place simply by sequentially storing the identification of the thread that was under execution when the interrupt occurred.</p>
