<h3>Current Program Status Register Value</h3>
<p> In ARM architecture, the current
			program status register (CPSR) is an unbanked register, thus it
			refers to the same physical register in all processor
			modes. It contains condition code flags, interrupt disable bits,
			the current processor mode, and other status and control
			information. The state of the processor reflects changes in the
			flags and values within the CPSR. CPSR cannot be changed while
			in user mode, thus preventing the software from accessing privileged resources. However, CPSR values
			can be investigated within user mode, making it possible to
			distinguish the current processor mode at all times. Performance
			measurements may require such investigation of the CPSR in order
			to distinguish the modes and to select appropriate actions
			according to the mode. Without such precautions, exceptions or
fault situations might take place.</p>
