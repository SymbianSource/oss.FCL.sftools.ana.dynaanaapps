<h3>Compile-Time Symbolic Information</h3>
<p>The deployment of programmed and compiled functionality within a final software image can be resolved from symbolic information that is produced at compile-time. In practice, symbolic information contains an address map of each of the data and code segments that have been produced within the compilation and combined when building a complete image in so-called rombuild stage (in Symbian toolchain). The address map connects the final addresses within a software image with names of functions, methods, dynamic link libraries, executables, device drivers, or other names that have been assigned by the programmer.</p>
<P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In performance evaluation, it is essential to be able to discriminate points of execution according to their presence in different functions. With the ability to perform such discrimination, it is possible to identify the functions and methods in which the execution has been recorded to take place. Accordingly, it is possible to calculate statistical utilization percentages for individual functions or methods. On the other hand, symbolic information has other applications. In general, without sources of symbolic information, performance measurement information cannot be grounded to the actual software design known by the developer, making it difficult to interpret the results. Through understanding of the memory layout of the analyzed software image, it becomes possible to perform more complicated analysis such as resolution of function call chains.</P>
