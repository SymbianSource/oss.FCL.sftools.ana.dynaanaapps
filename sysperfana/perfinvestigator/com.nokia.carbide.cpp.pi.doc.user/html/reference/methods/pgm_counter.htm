<h3>Program Counter Value</h3>
<p>Program counter is a special register in sequential processors following the principles of Von Neumann architecture. Its purpose is to store the address of the currently executing instruction. In performance measurements, the value of the program counter can be inspected in order to resolve the location of the current execution. On the other hand, program counter-relative values stored to the stack can be used to retrieve return values of branch instructions and interrupts. In ARM architecture, program counter is the register R15 but it is usually referred to as the PC. It is an unbanked register thus its value refers to the same physical register in each of the processor modes.<br>
