<h3>File System Storing</h3>
<p>Storing performance related data has to suit the performance measurement activity. If there is not much data, it can be exported from the device right away by suitable means, such as through the serial port. When the amount of data is larger, it can also be exported to a file within the file system. In that case it is practical to store the data at first to a small memory buffer. Then the buffer can be written to the file in a separate activity that does not disturb the measured mechanisms. For example if the data is being collected within an interrupt or in a kernel hook, the file system related activities should take place within the user code.</p>
