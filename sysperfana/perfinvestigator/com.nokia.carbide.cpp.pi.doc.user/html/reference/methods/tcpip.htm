<h3>TCP/IP Stack Efficiency and Its Tracing</h3>
<p>The networking efficiency here is perceived as effective network packet handling on receiver side of a connection over a wireless network. In this context, the performance tools intend to benchmark that efficiency in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>by tracking the usage of TCP/IP stack driver (GPP+ITT+GFC traces) and</li>
  <li>by measuring the network traffic itself (TIP trace) that is passed through the stack when the connection opened.</li>
</ul>
<P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>TCP/IP trace (or TIP trace) gathers information about packet sizes, source and destination addresses/ports and visualize the data in a cumulative graph. The main intention is to gather information about the causes of network traffic blocks whether they are caused by false implementation of an application or protocol stack or a result of highly loaded network.</P>
