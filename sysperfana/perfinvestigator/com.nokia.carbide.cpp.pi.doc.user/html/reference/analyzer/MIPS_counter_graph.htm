<h2>MIPS Counter and Graph</h2>

<p>The Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) graph gives you a general idea of
CPU speed in a measured use case. The basic use case for the MIPS analysis
would be to check any low areas in the graph since they may reveal unoptimized
features, for example, in terms of memory access (reads and writes). The higher
the MIPS values, the better and the faster the CPU is in executing
instructions.</p>

<p>A MIPS (Million Instructions Per Millisecond) graph is displayed in the
Performance Counters view, when <b>Instructions executed</b> has been selected
as one of the profiled counters. From PI Profiler version 2.2.1. onwards, CPU
speed data is included when "Instructions executed" profiled. For files created
with earlier PI Profiler versions, the dialog below is displayed during
PIAnalyser file import:</p>

<p>The processor speed information is needed for calculating the data for the
MIPS graph. The rest of the data for the calculation is always included in the
<b>Instructions executed</b> and <b>CPU cycles</b> counters.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/PEC_view_MIPS.png"></p>

<p>The MIPS counter information is displayed in the graphs view and the legend
table together with the other performance counters. Note, however, that for
MIPS only <b>Average (1/ms)</b>, <b>Min (1/ms)</b>, and <b>Max (1/ms)</b>
information is displayed in the legend table.</p>

<p>When the CPU speed data is included in the imported Profiler data file, a
CPU clock rate counter and graph are also displayed in the <a
href="view_performance_counters.htm">Performance Counters View</a>.</p>
