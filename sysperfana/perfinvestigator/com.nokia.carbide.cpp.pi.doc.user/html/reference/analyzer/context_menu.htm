<h2>Context Menu Options </h2>
<p>Right-clicking within the Analyzer graph and tables will display context popup menus that will vary slightly depending on where you initiated the popup menu. The following table lists and defines Analyzer context menu options.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note </strong>Several menu options allow you to save information to a .csv file that can be opened in a text editor or system editor (such as Excel). Beware that the default filename to save information is <span class="style1">new_file.csv</span>. Specify a unique filename if you do not want the default file to be overwritten each time you save information. </p>
