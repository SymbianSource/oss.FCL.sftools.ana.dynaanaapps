<h2>Interrupts View</h2>

<p>Use the Interrupts View to display information about data collected from SWI
and IRQ interrupts. The graph portion of the Interrupts view shows the amount
of interrupts per millisecond.</p>

<p>The Interrupts View has two different view options: Software interrupts (see
Figure 2.) or Hardware interrupts (see Figure 3.). The display is different
depending upon the view option selected in the Title bar drop-down menu, shown
in Figure 1.</p>

<p><strong>Software interrupts</strong></p>

<p>The Software interrupts graph displays the interrupts according to the
threads and SWI functions selected in the legend tables. A separate line of
graph is displayed for each selected thread, with the thread name in the top
left-hand corner. In the graph, the height of the column shows the amount of
interrupts, and each color represents an SWI function. The scaling of the
graphs is shown at the left side of the graph.</p>

<p align="center" class="figure">Figure 2. Software interrupts view</p>

<p>There are two legend tables displayed below the software interrupts graph:
One for the threads from a device and another for SWI functions.</p>

<p>Description of columns in the Threads table:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Thread</b> column identifies the thread by name and executable
    which is composed of: 
    <ul>
      <li>Executable or process name — name of the binary as identified by
        the OS</li>
      <li>Process ID (PID) — the process ID that uniquely identifies the
        process to the OS </li>
      <li>Thread name —the name of the thread</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <b>Address</b> column indicates the address of the thread object that
    was under execution during the time of the SWI.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can select the threads you want to display in the graph by checking the
box next to the thread name in the table. A separate line of graph is displayed
for each selected thread, with the thread name in the top left-hand corner.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Description of columns in the SWI Function table:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>SWI Function</b> column indicates the name of the function</li>
  <li>The <b>Return Address</b> column indicates the return address for the SWI
    call, i.e. the address for the “caller function” of each software
    interrupt</li>
  <li>The <b>Count</b> column indicates the number of interrupts for the
    selected area of the graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can select the functions you want to be displayed in the graph by
checking the box next to the function. Each function is represented by a unique
colour, shown next to the function name in the Function table.</p>

<p>The columns in the tables may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking
or dragging column headers.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Hardware interrupts</strong></p>

<p>The Hardware interrupts graph displays the interrupts for the selected IRQ
lines. A separate line of graph is displayed for each selected IRQ line, with
the line ID in the top left-hand corner. In the graph, the height of the column
shows the amount of interrupts. The scaling of the graphs is shown at the left
side of the graph.</p>

<p> A legend table is displayed below the graph. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/interrupts_view_HW.png" width="679"
height="493"></p>

<p align="center" class="figure">Figure 3. Hardware interrupts view</p>

<p>Description of the columns in the IRQ lines table:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>IRQ line</b> column indicates the ID of the actual IRQ line.</li>
  <li>The <b>Count</b> column indicates the number of interrupts for the
    selected area of the graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can select the IRQ line you want to be displayed in the graph by
checking the box next to the line ID in the table. The color next to a check
box corresponds to that item’s color in the graph.</p>

<p>The columns in the tables may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking
or dragging column header.</p>
