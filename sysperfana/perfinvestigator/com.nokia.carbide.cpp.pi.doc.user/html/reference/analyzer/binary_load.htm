<h2>Binary Load</h2>

<p>Select the Binaries tab to display the Binary Load. The Binary Load graph
and related table show information about binaries that were active during the
selected time period. The load is visually separated according to the executed
binary, independent of the thread or function that was executing. Figure 1
shows an example graph with the Binaries tab selected.</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 1. Example Binary Load Graph</p>

<p>You can check or uncheck items to be displayed in the graph or right-click
to display a context menu of various options. The color next to a checkbox
corresponds to that item’s color in the graph.</p>

<p>Description of table columns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The % Load column indicates what percentage of the CPU load was spent in
    each binary during the selected time interval.</li>
  <li>The Binary column identifies the binary files by name. </li>
  <li>The Path column shows the PC folder containing the binary.</li>
  <li>The Samples column indicates how many samples were taken during the
    selected time interval (in this case between XXX and YYY seconds).</li>
</ul>

<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column
headers.</p>

<p>The final row of the information section contains summary information about
all binaries below a threshold, if a threshold limit has been specified. The
threshold row is not affected by sorting, it is always the last row.</p>
