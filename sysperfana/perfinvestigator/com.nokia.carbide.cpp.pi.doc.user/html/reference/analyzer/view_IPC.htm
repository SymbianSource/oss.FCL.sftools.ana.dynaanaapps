<h2>Interconnect Performance Counters View</h2>

<p>Use the <strong>Interconnect Performance Counters</strong> view to monitor
Processor Sub-System (PSS) bus (VIA) accesses. By default, the Interconnect
Performance Counters view opens up as minimised on the PIAnalyzer main view. To
view the graphs, click the restore button <img
src="images/minimize_restore_graph.png" width="16" height="16"> or the maximize
button <img src="images/maximize_graph.png" width="16" height="16"> on the
Title bar.</p>

<p>The graph portion of the Performance Counters view displays graphs of the
selected traces. From all the IPC counters five different values are collected:
cycle, read, write, wait and idle counts. Those are shown on separate lines in
the graphs view, and the legend table. To select a trace for the graphs view,
click the check box next to the trace name in the legend table.</p>

<p>In the top left-hand corner of each graph line, the following information
displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type of the trace</li>
  <li>Sampling interval</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the scaling of the graphs changes according to the maximum values
for each graph. You can see the vertical axis values for each graph on the left
side of the graph.</p>

<p>You can move the mouse pointer on top of the graph lines to see the values
as a tooltip, as shown below in Figure 1.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A legend table is displayed below the graphs. </p>

<p>Description of the table columns: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Char</b> column contains an identifier for each trace.</li>
  <li>The <b>Name</b> column contains the type of performance counter that was
    traced.</li>
  <li>The <b>Average (1/ms)</b> column contains the average occurrence of the
    event that was traced, within the selected timeframe.</li>
  <li>The <b>Sum</b> column contains the total number of event occurrences
    within the selected timeframe.</li>
  <li>The <b>Min (1/ms)</b> column contains the minimum occurrence of the event
    that was traced, within the selected timeframe.</li>
  <li>The <b>Max (1/ms)</b> column contains the maximum occurrence of the event
    that was traced, within the selected timeframe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the boxes at the left side of the table to select the traces for the
graphs view.</p>

<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column
headers.</p>

<p>You can right-click on the table to open a context menu, where you can
select to copy either selected lines or the entire table to clipboard; or to
save the table to CSV format. </p>
