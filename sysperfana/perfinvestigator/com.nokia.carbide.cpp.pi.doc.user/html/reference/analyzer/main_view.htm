<h2>Analyzer View</h2>
<p>The main analysis view is visible after trace data taken by the profiler has been imported into Carbide.c++ and opened with the Analyzer. The thread load data in the main analysis view is built from the address/thread trace. Other trace data is also shown in the main analysis view, such as dynamic binary support trace and function call trace. Figure 1 is an example view of imported profiler data that has been opened with the analyzer, including memory and power usage information, with a time interval of 9.1 to 13 seconds selected.</p>

<p>The address/thread trace graph is the most generic and perhaps most informative visual of the sampled data.
  The different colors represent different items. You can select Thread load, Binary load, or Function load as shown in Figure 2. Time is represented on the horizontal axis of the graph and share of CPU use is represented on the vertical axis.</p>

<p>Each of the lines in the thread list represents a single thread. The color codes in the thread list correspond to the colors in the thread load graphs. Therefore, each color in the thread load graph represents the load of its corresponding thread.</p>
<p>You can select a portion of the graph by clicking on the trace graph. The Information view beneath the graph displays information about the currently selected part of the graph. For example, thread load statistics are shown in the information view if the thread load graph is selected.</p>
