<h2>Analyzer View</h2>

<p>The main analysis view is visible after trace data taken by Profiler has
been imported into Carbide.c++ and opened with Analyzer. The thread load data
in the main analysis view is built from the address/thread trace. Other trace
data is also shown in the main analysis view, such as dynamic binary support
trace and function call trace. Figure 1 is an example view of imported profiler
data that has been opened with the analyzer, including memory and power usage
information, with a time interval of 4 to 8 seconds selected.The Interrups
graph and Performance Counters graph have been minized.</p>

Memory, and Power graphs</p>

<p>The address/thread trace graph is the most generic and perhaps most
informative visual of the sampled data. The different colors represent
different items. Time is represented on the horizontal axis of the graph and
share of CPU use is represented on the vertical axis. You can select Thread
load, Binary load, or Function load by selecting the respective tabs at the
bottom of the main view, as shown in Figure 2.</p>

Functions, or Function Calls</p>

<p>Each of the lines in the thread table represents a single thread. The color
codes in the thread list correspond to the colors in the thread load graphs.
Therefore, each color in the thread load graph represents the load of its
corresponding thread.</p>

<p>You can select a portion of the graph by clicking on the trace graph. The
legend table beneath the graph displays information about the currently
selected part of the graph. For example, thread load statistics are shown in
the table if the thread load graph is selected.</p>
