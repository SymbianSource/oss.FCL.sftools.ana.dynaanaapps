<h2>Graphics Memory Usage View</h2>

<p>Use the <strong>Graphics Memory Usage</strong> view to display the private,
shared, or total graphics memory usage of processes running on a device. The
graph portion of the Graphics Memory Usage view shows the amount of graphics
memory used by the processes, and, if selected, the total amount of graphics
memory used at the time intervals selected for the GPU sampler in PI Profiler.
A list of processes appears at the bottom of the view showing the private,
shared and total memory usage for each process.</p>

<p>Data in the Graphics Memory Usage view is layered with the shared memory
usage data overlaying the private memory usage data. Private memory usage is
represented by light blue color, while shared memory usage is represented by
light green. You can select to view either private or shared graphics memory
usage, or both of them combined, by using the view options available in the
Title bar drop-down menu, shown in Figure 1, or in the
<strong>Investigator</strong> &gt; <a
href="menu_graphics_memory_graph.htm">Graphics Memory Graph Menu</a> . </p>

<p class="figure">Figure 1. Graphics Memory Usage Title bar drop-down menu</p>

<p>According to the selection, the graph displays the following (Figure 2):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Private Usage — light blue box only</li>
  <li>Shared Usage — light green box only </li>
  <li>Private and Shared Usage (Figure 2) — light blue box (private memory
    usage) and a light green line (shared memory usage) </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, a black line indicating the total graphics memory usage is
available. The line is always displayed by default, but you can choose to hide
or show the line by either right-clicking on the graph and selecting
<strong>Show Total Graphics Memory Usage</strong>, or by selecting
<strong>Investigator</strong> -&gt; <strong>Graphics Memory Graph</strong>
-&gt; <strong>Show Total Graphics Memory Usage</strong>. </p>

<p class="note">NOTE The difference between the cumulative (combined shared and
private usage) and total memory consumption (provided by the internal API) is
explained by the graphic acceleration system component itself: it cannot be
tracked by the GPU sampler of PI Profiler and therefore it is not visible in
the cumulative graph. In addition, if some graphics memory has been reserved
bypassing the graphic accelerator, for example using ARM interfaces (e.g.
camera application), the difference is even bigger. </p>

<p>You can also move the mouse pointer on top of the graph to see the amount of
graphics memory used at that time as a tooltip, as shown in Figure 2 below.</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 2. Graphics Memory Usage graph and thread list </p>

<p>Description of table columns (Figure 2):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Process</b> column lists the processes using graphics memory.</li>
  <li>The <b>Private</b> column displays the amount of private graphics memory
    used by each process for the selected time period (selection area on the
    graph).</li>
  <li>The <b>Shared</b> column displays the amount of shared memory used by the
    process for the selected time period (selection area on the graph)</li>
  <li>The <b>Memory Total</b> column displays the sum of the private and shared
    graphics memory usage for the selected time period (selection area on the
    graph).</li>
</ul>

<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column
headers.</p>

<p>Information on the graphics memory usage is also available in a separate <a
href="wnd_graphics_memory_usage_statistics.htm">Graphics Memory Usage
Statistics</a> dialog. You can open the dialog from the <a
href="context_menu.htm">context menu</a> by right-clicking on the Graphics
Memory Usage graph and selecting <a
href="wnd_graphics_memory_usage_statistics.htm">Graphics Memory Usage
Statistics</a>; or by selecting <strong>Investigator</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Graphics Memory Graph</strong> -&gt; <strong><strong>Graphics Memory
Usage Statistics</strong>.</strong></p>
