<h2>Performance Counters View</h2>

<p>Use the <strong>Performance Counters</strong> view to display information on
performance counter traces. By default, the Performance Counters view opens up
as minimised on the PIAnalyzer main view. To view the graphs, click the restore
button <img src="images\minimize_restore_graph.png" width="16" height="16"> or
the maximize button <img src="images\maximize_graph.png" width="16"
height="16"> on the Title bar.</p>

<p>The Performance Counters displayed in the view include two user selected
traces (A and B in Figure 1) and CPU cycles (C in Figure 1). A MIPS (Million
Instructions Per Second) counter is also available if <b>Instructions
executed</b> has been selected as one of the traces.</p>

<p>You can select which traces are displayed in the graphs view by clicking the
check box next to the trace name in the legend table below the graphs. When
several traces are selected, a separate graph line is displayed for each trace,
as shown in Figure 1. </p>

<p>In the top left-hand corner of each graph line, the following information
displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>type of the trace,</li>
  <li>the sampling interval (1 sample per millisecond in Figure 1),</li>
  <li>the minimum and maximum values over the whole duration of the trace.
    (Note that the legend table lists the minimum and maximum values only for
    the selected timeframe.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the scaling of the graphs changes according to the maximum values
for each graph. You can see the vertical axis values for each graph on the left
side of the graph.</p>

<p>A legend table is displayed below the graphs.</p>

<p>Description of the table columns: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Char</b> column contains an identifier for each trace.</li>
  <li>The <b>Name</b> column contains the type of performance counter that was
    traced.</li>
  <li>The <b>Average (1/ms)</b> column contains the average occurrence of the
    event that was traced, within the selected timeframe (for example, the
    average number of cache misses per millisecond, as shown in Figure 1).</li>
  <li>The <b>Sum</b> column contains the total number of event occurrences
    within the selected timeframe. (not included for MIPS)</li>
  <li>The <b>Min (1/ms)</b> column contains the minimum occurrence of the event
    that was traced, within the selected timeframe (for example, minimum number
    of data stalls per millisecond, as show in Figure 1).</li>
  <li>The <b>Max (1/ms)</b> column contains the maximum occurrence of the event
    that was traced, within the selected timeframe (for example, maximum number
    of data stalls per millisecond, as show in Figure 1).</li>
  <li>The <b>Per A</b> / <b>Per B</b> / <b>Per C</b> columns show the ratio of
    the values of the different traces (For example, Per A shows the number of
    events in the sum column of each trace divided by the sum of trace A). (not
    included for MIPS)</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the boxes at the right side of the table to select the traces for the
graphs view.</p>

<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column
headers.</p>

<p>You can right-click on the table to open a context menu, where you can
select to copy either selected lines or the entire table to clipboard; or to
save the table to CSV format. </p>

<p><strong>MIPS counter and graph</strong></p>

<p>The Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) graph gives you a general idea of
CPU speed in a measured use case. For more information, see <a
