<h2>Thread Load</h2>
<p>Select the Threads tab to display the Thread Load. The Thread Load graph and related table show information about threads that were active during the selected time period. The graph and table show the CPU load separated according to the executed thread, independent of the binary or function in which execution took place. Figure 1 shows an example graph with the Threads tab selected.</p>

<p>You can check or uncheck items to be displayed in the graph or right-click to display a context menu of various options. The color next to a checkbox corresponds to that itemâ€™s color in the graph.</p>
<p>Description of table columns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>% Load</b> column indicates what percentage of the CPU load was spent in each thread during the selected time interval.</li>
<li>The <b>Thread</b> column identifies the thread by name and executable which is composed of:
    <ul>
      <li>Executable or process  name &#8212; name of the binary as identified by the OS</li>
      <li>Process ID (PID) &#8212;  the process ID that uniquely identifies the process to the OS </li>
      <li>Thread name  &#8212;the name of the thread</li>
      <li>Thread ID (TID) &#8212;  the thread ID that uniquely identifies the thread </li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>The <b>Samples</b> column indicates how many samples were taken during the selected time interval (in this case between 8.16 and 8.5 seconds).</li>
<li>If the profiler data file contained thread priority information, then a <b>Priority List</b> column will be shown.  The column lists the time at which a thread was assigned that priority. Sometimes you will see more than one priority listed for each thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column headers.</p>
<p> The final row of the information section contains summary information about all threads below a threshold, if a threshold limit has been specified. The threshold row is not affected by sorting, it is always the last row.</p>
