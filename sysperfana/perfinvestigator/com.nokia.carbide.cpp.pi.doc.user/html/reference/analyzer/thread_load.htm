<h2>Thread Load</h2>

<p>Select the Threads tab to display the Thread Load. The Thread Load graph and
related table show information about threads that were active during the
selected time period. The graph and table show the CPU load separated according
to the executed thread, independent of the binary or function in which
execution took place. Figure 1 shows an example graph with the Threads tab
selected.</p>

<p>Description of table columns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>% Load</b> column indicates what percentage of the CPU load was
    spent in each thread during the selected time interval.</li>
  <li>The <b>Thread</b> column identifies the thread by name and executable
    which is composed of: 
    <ul>
      <li>Executable or process name — name of the binary as identified by
        the OS</li>
      <li>Process ID (PID) — the process ID that uniquely identifies the
        process to the OS </li>
      <li>Thread name —the name of the thread</li>
      <li>Thread ID (TID) — the thread ID that uniquely identifies the thread
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <b>Samples</b> column indicates how many samples were taken during
    the selected time interval (in this case between 8.16 and 8.5 seconds).</li>
  <li>If the profiler data file contained thread priority information, then a
    <b>Priority List</b> column will be shown. The column lists the time at
    which a thread was assigned that priority. Sometimes you will see more than
    one priority listed for each thread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column
headers.</p>

<p>The final row of the information section contains summary information about
all threads below a threshold, if a threshold limit has been specified. The
threshold row is not affected by sorting, it is always the last row.</p>

<p>You can check or uncheck items to be displayed in the graph or right-click
to display a context menu of various options. The color next to a checkbox
corresponds to that item’s color in the graph.</p>

<p>For SMP systems with more than one CPU it is also possible to select to</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Show Combined CPU Graph</b>, that is, to view all CPUs merged into one
    graph, as in Figure 1, or</li>
  <li><b>Show Separate CPU Graphs</b>, that is, to view a separate graph and
    table for each CPU, as in Figure 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is done by using either the context menu, which you can open by
right-clicking on the CPU graph; or in the <a
href="investigator_menu.htm">Investigator menu</a>'s CPU Load Graphs part.</p>

separate CPU graphs</p>

<p>In the separate graphs view, there is also a separate legend table created
for each graph. You can choose the table you want to view by using the tabs
above the table. </p>
