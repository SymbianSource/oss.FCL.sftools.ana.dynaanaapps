<p>Below are listed the error messages and resolutions for problems with the PI
Import wizard during file import.</p>

      <td>Unable to resolve current connection. Please check your connection
        settings.</td>
      <td>This message usually appears when you select to get profiler files
        form device via TraceViewer for the first time, and the connections
        settings have not yet defined. 

        <p>To resolve the problem, click <strong>Connection
        Settings...</strong> to open the dialog where you can select the
        correct settings for the connection you want to use. After saving the
        settings, click Refresh Plug-ins List and continue with tracing. For
        more specific instructions, see <a
        href="../../tasks/analyser/an_load_trace_files.htm">Importing Profiler
        Data files</a>.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Could not read available plug-ins from device. See Troubleshooting
        topic from Help.</td>
      <td><p>This message appears when the connection settings have been
        defined, but the information for the plug-in list cannot be fetched.</p>

        <p>To resolve the problem, test that the Tracing service connection is
        working:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click <strong>Connection Settings... </strong></li>
          <li>Select the connection you are using and click
            <strong>Edit...</strong></li>
          <li>Select the <strong>Test Connection</strong> tab</li>
          <li>Select the Device OS</li>
          <li>Select Tracing as the service to test</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Initiate Service Testing</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If the connection works, but you still get the error message, makes
        sure that PI Profiler is installed on the device.</p>

      <td>This message appears when try to use a USB connections for profiling
        several plugins, and the connection cannot handle the amount of data. 

        <p>To resolve the problem, try profiling fewer plugins; or, if you need
        to profile several plugins in the same trace, change to TCP/IP Musti
        connection. For more specific instructions, see <a
        href="../../tasks/analyser/an_load_trace_files.htm">Importing Profiler
        Data files</a>.</p>

      <td>Multiple problems have occurred. Jave heap space.</td>
      <td>This message can appear when you try to import a large profiler date
        file. 

        <p>Although Carbide.c++ reserves a large block of memory for the Java
        Virtual Machine (JVM) to run the whole IDE, in some cases, the trace
        import process may fail due to out-of-memory situation. This is usually
        due to the Profiler trace log being too long in time and/or CPU load
        being extensively high over the use case. The out-of-menory may also
        lead to instability issues with Carbide itself, in which case the error
        is shown.</p>

        <p>This problem can be avoided by keeping the profiled use cases
        shorter (the recommendation is maximum 5 minutes), and by selecting
        only those Profiler plug-ins that are needed for analysing the use
        case. Shorter use cases (in time) and smaller amount of selected
        profiler plug-ins also ease up the analysis phase, since it is easier
        to a browse shorter set of data and to pinpoint the possible
        performance issues within the trace.</p>

        <p>If you need to analyse longer use cases, there are also other tools
        available for long-period-testing (LPT). For example, you can run the
        Nokia Energy Profiler (NEP) directly on target and it can be used for
        LPT type of use cases.</p>
