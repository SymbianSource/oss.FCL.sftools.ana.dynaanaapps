<h2>Memory Usage View</h2>
<p>Use  the <strong>Memory  Usage</strong> view to display thread&#8217;s chunk usage, stack/heap usage, or both, of the profiled software running on a device. The graph portion of the Memory Usage view shows the amount of memory used along the same time interval as the thread load. A list of each thread or process appears at the bottom of the view showing the chunks, stack/heap, and total memory for each thread.</p>
<p>Data in the Memory Usage view is layered with the stack/heap data overlaying the chunk data. Stack/heap data is represented by the color blue, while chunk data is represented by gold. The display is different depending upon the view option selected in the context menu (section A in Figure 1):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show Chunk Usage &#8212; gold box only</li>
  <li>Show Stack/Heap Usage &#8212; blue box only </li>
  <li>Show Chunk and Stack/Heap Usage (Figure 1) &#8212; show gold box (chunk data) and a blue line (stack/heap data) </li>
</ul>
<p>When both are selected for display and the amounts are also equal, only a blue box will appear in the view. If the amounts are not equal, the chunk data is shown as a gold box and the stack/heap data is shown as a blue line. </p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> The Memory Usage view is synchronized with the Thread Load view along the horizontal axis. </p>

<p>Description of table columns (section B in Figure 1):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Thread/Process</b> column name contains a wealth of data and is composed of:<ul>
    <li>Chunks appear as: <span class="code">&lt;process&gt;::&lt;chunk name&gt; [&lt;hex start address&gt;]</span> </li>
      <li>Threads appear as: <span class="code">&lt;process&gt;::&lt;thread name&gt;_&lt;thread ID&gt; </span></li>
      <li> If no name is returned by the OS, the entry may appear as undetermined, e.g. &quot;<span class="code">::_</span>&quot;. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <b>Chunks</b> column displays the  amount of memory used by each chunk.</li>
  <li>The <b>Stack/Heap</b> column displays the  amount  of memory used by the thread in its stack/heap.</li>
  <li>The <b>Memory Total</b> column displays the  sum of the Chunks and Stack/Heap columns. </li>
</ul>
<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column headers.</p>
