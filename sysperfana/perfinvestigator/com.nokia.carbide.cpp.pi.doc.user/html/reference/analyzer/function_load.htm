<h2>Function Load</h2>
<p>Select the Functions tab to display the Function Load. The function load graph and related table show information about functions that were active during the selected time period. In Function mode, the graph and information views show the CPU load separated at a function level, independent of the thread that has been executing it. Figure 1 shows an example of the Function tab selected and Function load displayed.</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 1. Function Load Graph</p>
You can check or uncheck items to be displayed in the graph or right-click to display a context menu of various options. The color next to a checkbox corresponds to that item’s color in the graph.
<p>Description of table columns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>% Load</b> column indicates what percentage of the CPU load was spent in each function during the selected time interval.</li>
<li>The <b>Function Start</b> column displays the hexadecimal start address of each function.</li>
<li>The <b>In Binary</b> column indicates the binary containing each function.</li>
<li>The <b>Path of Binary</b> column lists the PC folder containing each function’s binary.</li>
<li>The <b>Samples</b> column indicates how many samples were taken during the selected time interval (in this case between 10 and 12.8 seconds).</li>
</ul>
<p>Columns may be reordered, resized, and sorted by clicking or dragging column headers.</p>
<p>The final row of the information section contains summary information about all functions below a threshold, if a threshold limit is specified. The threshold row is not affected by sorting, it is always the last row.</p>
