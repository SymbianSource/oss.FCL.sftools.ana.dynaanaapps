<h2>Save Table</h2>
<p>The Save Table dialog allows you to save the contents of the entire table in the current pane to a specified (.csv) file. Column titles will be included for easy identification when opened in an spreadsheet for analysis. The table contents do not have to be selected for the table to be saved. Figure 1 shows the Save Table dialog. You can select an existing project and folder in which to add the .csv file or select the <strong>Create Empty Project...</strong> button to create a new empty project to contain the new .csv file.</p>

<p>If you select the <strong>Create Empty Project...</strong> button, the New Project dialog will appear as shown in Figure 2. Enter a project name and specify a workspace location to store the project. Click Next to specify project dependencies or click Finish to create the new project. If you select Finish at this point, then you can select the new project (in the list of projects) as the project to contain the .csv file.</p>

In Project <SPAN name="resultofMatch"><SPAN name="resultofMatch">Referenc</SPAN>es</SPAN>, you can set <SPAN name="resultofMatch">project</SPAN> dependencies for   the new <SPAN name="resultofMatch">project</SPAN>. In the   list of other <SPAN name="resultofMatch">project</SPAN>s in   the Workspace, you can select one or more <SPAN name="resultofMatch">project</SPAN>s on which you want the new <SPAN name="resultofMatch">project</SPAN> to depend upon. Click Finish to return to the main Save Table dialog and select the new project as the project to contain the .csv file.
