<h2>Changing Graph Colors</h2>
<p>Threads, binaries, and functions are assigned default colors when displayed on the graph. You can change the color representing an item. In either the Threads, Binaries, or Functions table, select one or more items and right-click to display context sensitive menu, as shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p align="left">Select Recolor Highlighted Functions... to display a color swatch. Select a new color for selected item and click OK. The new color is visible in the table when the item is deselected, since the complete line appears grey when highlighted.</p>
<p align="left" class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The menu option will indicate Recolor Highlighted Functions, Recolor Highlighted Binaries, or Recolor Highlighted Threads depending on which table is currently active.</p>
<p align="left">You can use the shift and control keys and the left mouse button to select multiple items. If multiple items are selected, then the swatch is displayed for each item selected. To select the same color for multiple selections, you will need to select the color and click OK for each swatch.</p>
<p align="left" class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, any recoloring changes you make to binary and thread items will dirty the file, and will be saved to the .npi file when you save the file. Any recoloring changes you make to function items will not be saved. For function items, default colors are restored when the .npi file is reopened.<br>
