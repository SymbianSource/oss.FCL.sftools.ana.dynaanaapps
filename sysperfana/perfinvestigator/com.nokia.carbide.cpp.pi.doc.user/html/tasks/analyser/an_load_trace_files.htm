<h2>Importing Profiler Data Files</h2>

<p>After capturing run-time information from your application on the target
device, saving the profiler data file, and transferring the file to your PC,
you must then import the profiler data (.dat) file. Importing the data file
converts the file into a format that can be displayed by the analyzer (a .NPI
file).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong> If a large .dat file is imported, the
graph and table response time will slow down until the large NPI file is saved.
Saving the NPI file will be performed in the background and cannot be
canceled.</p>

<p>Importing a profiler data file will vary depending on if your application
was built by Carbide.c++ or is a standalone application. To find the binaries
in your application, the importer will need the *.pkg file created when your
application was built, or you will need to list all application binaries. If
you wish to analyze applications that execute at a static address, you will
need the ROM image .symbol file that represents your phone. For dynamically
loaded binaries stored in a phone&rsquo;s ROFS or ROM, a .oby file can be used
to describe and list binaries.</p>

<p>Unless your application executes from a fixed address in phone memory (e.g.,
is part of the flashed phone image), enable dynamic binary support in the
Profiler application when capturing your application data in a profiler data
file.</p>

<p>To import your profiler data file, perform the following steps.</p>

<div class="step">
<h4>Importing a Profiler Data File</h4>
<ol>
  <li><a name="Select_Performance_Investigator_Data"></a>Select Performance
    Investigator Data</li>

  <p>Select <strong>File &gt; Import...</strong> from Carbide.c++ to display
  Import dialog box (Figure 1), and select Performance Investigator Data and
  click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>

      <li><strong>Add File</strong> and browsing to the file, or</li>
      <li><strong>Add Directory</strong> and browsing to the directory you want
        to import files from.</li>
      <li>The .dat file(s) will be converted to a format displayable by the
        Carbide.c++ analyzer and assigned the .npi extension. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>After selecting the file, the <strong>PI views included in the
    analysis</strong><strong>for <em>filename</em>.dat</strong> table will
    display a list of available views, according to the trace types available
    in the selected .dat file. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>By default, all available trace types in the table are selected, so
        you can de-select the types you do not wish to include in the analysis.
        The CPU load view is a mandatory analysis and cannot be
      de-selected.</li>

    in remaining pages, since there is no previous import related to the new
    workspace. For a new imported .dat file, a new output file name will be
    generated based on this input file name (+ (digit) + .npi).</p>
