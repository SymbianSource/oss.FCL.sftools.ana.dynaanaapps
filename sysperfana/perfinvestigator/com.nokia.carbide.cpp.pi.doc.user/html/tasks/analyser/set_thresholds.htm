<h2>Setting Thresholds For Threads, Binaries, and Functions</h2>
<p>Thresholds can be set to group threads, binaries, and/or functions according to their amount of CPU usage into a pile you do not care about. For example, you can specify all functions using less than 5 percent of the CPU load to be ignored. Then you can focus on other functions in the graph that occupy more than 5 percent of the CPU.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must select a time interval on the graph to view statistics for an item; such as the percent of CPU usage and number of times sampled.</p>
