<h2><a name="example" id="example"></a>Examining a Profiling Project</h2>

<p>The purpose of creating a profiling use case is to analyze the performance
of Symbian OS applications. In general, the objective is to define the behavior
of an application and its environment when they are interacting. When designing
a profiling use case, it helps to document the process and save log files.</p>

<p>Existing test cases created by application developers or test personnel can
be used as a template. However, consider the following when designing and
preparing a test of a profiling use case.</p>

<p>High Profiler sampling rates can cause trace files to grow excessively
large, especially if the test lasts for a long time. Therefore, it is
recommended that the duration of the test be as short as possible. The maximum
duration of a profiling test is typically two to three minutes. There should
also be reasonable gaps between input events so that specific events can be
easily detected and distinguished from the trace log.</p>

<p>The following example describes in a high-level how to search for
performance bottlenecks. Refer to Figure 1 to illustrate an example of
determining time spent in a particular application and the related functions
consuming most of the CPU time.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/GS_example_figure1.png" /></p>

<p align="center" class="figure">Figure 1. Examining a Specific Application</p>

<p align="left">As shown in Figure 1, examine the thread load graph and select
the time interval of interest. In this example, the selected time interval is
21.010 to 21.970 seconds.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 1 indicates the three most CPU time consuming threads in
the time frame 21-22 seconds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>23.02% Null</li>
  <li>16.56% Wserv_36 </li>
  <li>15.31% Main_295</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that only <span class="code">Null (ekern.exe[1]::Null_0)</span>
and<span class="code">Wserv_36</span> are checked and thus are shown in the
graph. To add or remove threads from the graph, use the shift and control keys
to check or uncheck multiple lines. Right-click to display a context menu for
more options.</p>

<p>You can determine which binaries are executed by the threads during the
21-22 second interval by right-clicking inside the table and selecting
<strong>Thread &gt; Binary</strong>. This will change the graph displayed to
the binary load graph in Figure 2.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/GS_example_figure2.png" /></p>

<p align="center" class="figure">Figure 2. Binary Load Graph </p>

<p>As shown in Figure 2, this application spends 21.25% of the time in the
<span class="code">_reka2_ekern.exe</span> binary. At the lowest level, you can
find out which functions are executed by the binaries that execute during the
21-22 second interval by right-clicking inside either table and selecting
<strong>Thread &gt; Binary &gt; Function</strong>. This will change the graph
displayed to the function load graph in Figure 3.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> For each selected binary in Figure 2,
the Analyser graphs all of that binary's samples, just as if you had selected
that binary in the Binaries tab. The graph does not only show binary samples
that are also associated with threads <span
class="code">ekern.exe[1]::Null_0</span> and<span class="code">Wserv_36</span>.
We expect to deliver that functionality in a future release. Keep this in mind
as you drill down into a specific thread, binary, or function.</p>

<p align="center" class="figure">Figure 3. Function Load Graph</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows that 9.90% of the execution time was spent in a single
function called NKern::RestoreInterrupts(int), within the _reka2_ekern.exe
binary. In the Function table scroll to see the <strong>In Binary</strong>
column to determine the binary containing the function.</p>

<p>Select the Function Calls tab to view the Function Call Analysis tables, as
shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/GS_example_figure4.png" width="682"
height="574" /></p>

<p align="center" class="figure">Figure 4. Function Call Analysis</p>

<p align="left">Individual functions can be selected to determine, within the
time frame 21-22 seconds, which functions called the selected function and
which functions were called by the selected function. You can sort functions by
clicking the headings provided for each column.</p>
