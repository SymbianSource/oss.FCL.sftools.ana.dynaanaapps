<h2>Crash Analyser main view</h2>
<p>The Crash Analyser main view lists all files that have been imported with the Crash Analyser Import Wizard. You can see all files handled during the previous time you used the tool.</p>
<p>There are four different file types viewable in the main view:</p>
<table width="667" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2">
<colgroup>
<col width="50*">
<col width="141*">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><b>File type</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Decoded file</b><p></p><img src="images\file_de_coded.png"></td>
<td>A file that has been changed from binary format to XML format. You can open this file for further analysis in the Carbide.c++ Editor area. For more information, see <a href="../concepts/analysis_file.htm">Analysis file</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Partially decoded file</b><p></p><img src="images\file_part_coded.png"></td>
<td>A file that is otherwise same as the decoded file, but the decoding of this file is done without symbol information, that is, neither a symbol file nor map files are included when decoding. You can open this file for further analysis in the Carbide.c++ Editor area, but you have less information available compared to the decoded file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Undecoded file</b><p></p><img src="images\file_coded.png"></td>
<td>A MobileCrash file in binary format. This file has not been changed from binary format to XML format. This file is displayed in the main view, but you cannot open it for further analysis. However, if you want to open it for further analysis, you can decode it with the Crash Analyser Import Wizard. After that, the file is ready for further analysis. <b>Note!</b> Normally, the MobileCrash files have the <i>.bin</i> file extension, but if you take the MobileCrash file through TraceViewer, then the file extension is <i>.trace</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Emulator panic file</b><p></p><img src="images\emulator.PNG"></td>
<td>If a panic occurs when debugging with emulator, Crash Analyser creates an emulator panic file and shows it in the main view. This file differs from the other ones because it does not include any crash data, but only the panic code. You cannot open this file for further analysis and you cannot decode it with the Import Wizard. The only information you can get is the panic code and the panic code description supported by the error library.</td>
</tr>
