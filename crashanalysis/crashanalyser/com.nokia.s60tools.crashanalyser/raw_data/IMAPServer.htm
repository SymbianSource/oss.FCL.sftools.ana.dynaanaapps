<p>
IMAPServer panics are raised by the IMAP server-side MTM. They are used
to signal errors in the implementation of the MTM, and are raised in debug
builds. The panic codes are divided into a number of ranges, each of which
relates to a particular area of functionality in the MTM: 
</p>
<code>0-999</code>
