<h1>ViewSrv</h1>
<p>
The table below lists the View Server panics.</p>
<code>1</code>
<p>
View Server creation failed. 
</p>
<code>3</code>
<p>
A bad client call was made - i.e. the opcode sent by the client was
one not defined in <code>TVwsRequestOpcode</code>. 
</p>
<code>6</code>
<p>
The view that View Server is trying to remove has not been found. 
</p>
<code>7</code>
<p>
An application tried to add a view with an application UID other
than its own. 
</p>
<code>8</code>
<p>
The custom message sent along with a view activation request was
not copied across to the server properly. 
</p>
<code>9</code>
<p>
An attempt was made to remove the currently active view. 
</p>
<code>10</code>
<p>
A client has requested a view event even though it still has an
outstanding request open. 
</p>
<code>11</code>
<p>
The most common panic. A view has taken too long to complete its
implementation of <code>ViewActivatedL()</code> and must, therefore, be
panicked to stop it from blocking the entire OS. 
</p>
<code>13</code>
<p>
An attempt was made to activate a view that does not support the
current screenmode.
