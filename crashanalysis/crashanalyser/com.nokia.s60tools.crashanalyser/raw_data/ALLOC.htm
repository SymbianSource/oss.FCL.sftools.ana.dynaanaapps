<p>These panics are raised in debug builds only and are caused when the heap debugging functions detect a memory
leak.</p>
<code> nnnnnnnn</code>
<p>This panic is raised by the <code class="ApiItem">RHeap::__DbgMarkEnd()</code>  and <a href="../reference-cpp/E32_EKA2/UserClass.html#%3a%3aUser%3a%3a__DbgMarkEnd%28%29" title="function User::__DbgMarkEnd()"><code class="ApiItem">User::__DbgMarkEnd()</code></a> when the number of heap cells at the current nested level is not as
expected.
