<h2>Understanding tracing</h2>
<p>Tracing is a way to record debugging information that can be used during 
software development. With tracing, you can generate detailed, low-level 
information about an application's execution in the target device.</p>
<p>Examples of tracing are cases when messages are sent or received from a 
component, when states change, when a certain function is entered or exited, 
or anywhere else in the code where it is interesting to know if code has been 
executed or not.</p>
<p>The tracing tools support <b>Open System Trace (OST)</b> trace format for 
data transfer. OST is an open, platform-independent solution that is easily 
integrated into the software development process.</p>
