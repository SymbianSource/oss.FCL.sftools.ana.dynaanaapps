<h2>Setting filtering options</h2>
<p>TraceViewer provides various options for setting up filtering. 
In some cases, it may also be necessary to use an external filter 
application to modify the results. For instructions, 
see <a href="externalfilter.htm">Using an external filter application</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="basic"></a>Basic options</h3>
<p>You can create new filter rules in the basic <b>Rules</b> dialog, as for 
other items. For instructions, see <a href="setup_rules.htm">Setting up rules 
and filters</a>.</p>

<p>To set filtering-specific options: </p>
<ol>
<li>After the rules are defined, select one or more of them from the tree.</li>
<li>Select either <b>Hide</b> or <b>Show</b>, to make the selected rules visible
on the tree. <p><img src="images\filterDialog.png" alt="Special fields in Filter Rules dialog"></p></li>
<li>Select either the <b>OR</b> or <b>AND</b> operator:
<ul>
<li>OR means that if a trace hits just one rule, it is applied. </li>
<li>AND means that the trace must hit all the selected rules for it to be
applied. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To take the selected rules to use, click <b>Apply</b>.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="advanced"></a>Creating rule statements</h3>
<p>You can make also more complicated filtering rules by setting advanced options. The point
is to make an effective and reasonable filter rule set, which will then be
used when filtering traces.</p>
<p>A rule set is written the form of a statement such as this: </p>
<p><i>(rule AND rule2) OR (smallRule AND NOT filterRule)</i></p>
<p>where traces are included or excluded based on this criterion. </p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You can also type the rule set statement manually into
the text field. </p>
<p>To set advanced options: </p>
<ol>
<li>In the <b>Filter Rules</b> dialog, click <b>Advanced</b>. <p>The <b>Advanced
Filter Rules</b> dialog is displayed, showing the basic rules already created. 
</p></li>
<li>To start creating a new rule set, click <b>Start Set</b>. <p>An opening
parenthesis ( is inserted into the text field to indicate the beginning.</p></li>
<li>To edit the rule set, select rules from the tree and combine them with
each other by clicking any of the following buttons: 
<ul>
<li><b>AND:</b> Indicates logical AND. Is used between two rules or rule sets
and means that both rules / sets will have to hit the rule for it to be true.
</li>
<li><b>OR:</b> Indicates logical OR. Is used between two rules or rule sets
and means that either rule / set will have to hit the rule for it to be true.
</li>
<li><b>NOT:</b> Indicates logical NOT. Is used before a rule or rule set.
Indicates that the rule / rule set after the NOT can not hit the rule for
it to be true.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Back</b> button removes the last word from the text field,
starting from the caret position. </p></li>
<li>(Optional) To quickly add all the rules from a group to the set, click
the group name on the tree. <p>From the pop-up, select OR or AND. After choosing,
all the rules from this group are added to the text field, separated by the
selected logical operation. </p><p><img src="images/advancedFilterDialogGroup.png"

<li>Click <b>End Set</b> to insert a closing parenthesis ) into the field. <p><b>
Note:</b> TraceViewer automatically checks that the rule is reasonable and
well-formed, that is, contains as many start brackets as end brackets. The
following is an example of a reasonable filter rule set that is correct and
ready to be applied: </p><p><img src="images/advancedFilterDialogReady.png"

<li>(Optional) To hide or show a trace that hits this filter rule, change
the value of <b>Show</b> and <b>Hide</b> selection as needed.</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b> to save the rule set. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>To clear the rule text field and start creating a new one, click <b>Clear
</b>. </li>
<li>To return to the <b>Basic</b> dialog, click <b>Simple</b>.</li>
</ul>
