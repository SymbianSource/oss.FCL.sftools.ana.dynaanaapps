<h2>Configuring logging for traces</h2>

<p>You can create a log out of the received traces. The log can be either a
plain text (ASCII) log file that can be opened in a normal text editor, or a
binary log file that will contain all the data in the same form as coming from
the trace source. Note that the binary file can only be opened in TraceViewer.
</p>

<p>Some typical cases for logging could be: </p>
<ul>
  <li>To work the with trace data independently of the device (uses binary
    logs).</li>
  <li>To compare two logs taken from the same test case, run at different times
    (uses ASCII logs).</li>
  <li>To analyse the log in other applications (uses ASCII logs). </li>
</ul>

<p>To start logging, do the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>From the TraceViewer menu, select <b>Log...</b>. 
    <p>A submenu containing options is displayed. You have multiple choices:</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To open a previously written ASCII or Binary log file, select <b>Open
    log</b>. A file selection dialog is displayed where you can select your log
    file.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To write a new Binary log, select <b>New Binary log</b>. A file
    selection dialog is displayed where you can select where to create your log
    file.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To save currently shown traces to a Binary log file, select <b>Save
    current traces to Binary log</b>. A file selection dialog is displayed
    where you can select where to create your log file.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To stop currently ongoing Binary logging, select <b>Close Binary
    log</b>. This option is not selectable if Binary logging is not ongoing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To write a new ASCII log, select <b>New ASCII log</b>. A file
    selection dialog is displayed where you can select where to create your log
    file. After file selection, a dialog is displayed where you can select few
    options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>(Optional) To omit timestamps from the plain text log files for a
        better comparability between the log files, select <b>Omit timestamps
        from the log</b>.</p>
        <p>This option is useful for situations where the timestamp information
        does not bring additional value to the analysis of data.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>(Optional) To write a machine readable plain text log file, select
        <b>Write machine readable ASCII log</b>.</p>
        <p>This log file format is easy to read using automatic scripts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p>To save currently shown traces to a ASCII log file, select <b>Save
    current traces to ASCII log</b>. A file selection dialog is displayed where
    you can select where to create your log file.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>To stop the currently ongoing ASCII logging, select <b>Close ASCII
    log</b>. This option is not selectable if ASCII logging is not ongoing. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you have added comments to the traces, they will get written
to a separate file called &lt;log_file_name&gt;.meta. To see the comments when
you open the log file to TraceViewer, the .meta file must be in the same
directory as the log file itself.</p>
