<h2>Decoding binary traces with a Dictionary file</h2>
<p>To activate and deactivate binary traces that are in the Open
System Trace (OST) format, you must first define the used <i>Dictionary file
</i> for the component that is outputting the traces. Dictionary files are
in XML and are usually available in your development environment. They are
automatically re-generated everytime you compile a component that contains
OST traces.</p>
<p>You can open a Dictionary file to be used for decoding
binary traces, based on a decode model.</p>
<p>To open a Dictionary file: </p>
<ol>
<li>On the TraceViewer menu, select <b>Trace Activation</b>. </li>
<li>In the <b>Activation</b> dialog, click <b>Add Dictionary</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>Open file</b> dialog, choose one or more decode files from the
file system. <p>By default, these files are located in the <i>\epoc32\ost_dictionaries</i> directory, and named <i>[componentname]_uid_dictionary.xml</i><br>
<b>Note</b>: You can also load a ZIP file containing one or more Dictionary files.
</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b>. <p>TraceViewer will load the chosen files to the decoding
model and decode the traces currently in the view.</p> </li>
</ol>
