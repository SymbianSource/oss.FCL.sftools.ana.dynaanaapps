<h2>Connecting to the trace source</h2>
<h5>Before you start</h5>
<p>Before you can connect to the trace source and start receiving traces, the
connection options must be defined in TraceViewer preferences. The connection
method is <b>USB</b>. For more information on
the options, see <a href="../reference/preferencesconnection.htm">Connection
settings</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, you can specify various types of rules and
filters to receive just the information you need for your specific components
and groups, and the level of tracing that is relevant for your development
team's purposes. For more information, see the overview in <a
href="../gettingstarted/basic_steps.htm">Basic steps</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>When the preferences are set, simply click <b>Connect</b> to connect to
the trace source: <p><img src="images/connectBar1.png" alt="Connect button"></p></li>
<li>When the green connect button changes to red <b>Disconnect</b> button,
the connection is successfully established:<p><img src="images/connectBar2.png"

<li><p>You can pause receiving traces by clicking the <b>Pause</b> button:

<p><b>Note:</b> There are also situations where the view is automatically paused.
These include, for example, triggering an action which will open a dialog.
When the dialog is closed, the view is then released. </p></li>
<li>When you are done working with the received traces, you can clear the
view with the <b>Clear view</b> button.<p><img src="images/clearviewBar.png"

<p>All the data received before clicking this button will be lost.</p></li>
