<h2>Viewing line count and variable tracing items</h2>
<h5>Before you start</h5>
<p>On the <b>TraceViewerPropertyView</b>, you can check the properties
of traces the based on the rules that were defined for line count and variable
tracing.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Line count</b> can be used to calculate the number of occurrences for
a certain type of trace. This may mean, for example, a trace from a specific
component, from a certain group of a certain component, or traces that contain
a certain text. </li>
<li><b>Variable tracing</b> means that you can follow up or monitor certain
values that occur in traces. <p>For example, to monitor RAM consumption in
the Kernel, there can be the following kind of trace: <br><br><i>00:11:31:624
[0] Kernel Memory:Initial free RAM;Bytes:127598592</i><br><br>When you create
a variable tracing rule that contains the text <i>Kernel Memory:Initial free
RAM;Bytes</i>, you can view what the latest value of this variable was, as
well as a number of its previous values.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For generic instructions on how to create rules and definitions, see
instructions in <a href="setup_rules.htm">Setting up rules and filters</a>.

<h3><a name="varhist"></a>Viewing variable tracing history</h3>
<p>To open the history: </p>
<ol>
<li>Select one or more items from the list. </li>
<li>Right-click and select <b>Open history</b> from the menu.
<p>The <b>Variable tracing history</b> dialog is displayed.</p>
<p><img src="images/variabletracingHistoryDialog.png"
alt="Variable Tracing History Dialog"></p>
<p>In the history, you can see the last <i>n</i> number of events of 
the variable changing. There is a timestamp (and time from the previous event), 
new value and the line number where the change happened. The <b>Has codeline</b> 
column indicates whether or not this item has location metadata available.</p></li>
<li>(Optional) To open the source code of a line that has had changes:
<ol>
<li>Select the <b>Activate corresponding codeline</b> box.</li>
<li>Double-click a line that shows <b>Yes</b> in the <b>Has codeline</b> column. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(Optional) To view the line number where changes happened:
<ol>
<li>Select the <b>Activate corresponding trace</b> box, if not selected already. </li>
<li>Double-click a line in the dialog and TraceViewer jumps to that line in the code. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: If you close TraceViewer when you have any of the variable
tracing rules enabled, they will get automatically enabled the next time you start TraceViewer.</p>
