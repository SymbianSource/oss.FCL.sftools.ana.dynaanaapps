<h2>TraceViewer overview</h2>
<p>TraceViewer is a tool for tracing a target device in the Carbide.c++ 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The target device can be 
connected to the PC through USB.</p>
<p>TraceViewer is useful for developers or testers in obtaining and analyzing, for example,
component-specific data during a test case. With this tool, you can manipulate
and filter the received traces in various ways to pin-point the relevant information
that affects your components. In addition, the tool enables you to define
exactly what type of trace data you want to activate and receive.</p>
<p>TraceViewer supports the Open System Trace (OST) trace format for data transfer. 
The OST solution includes the following features: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Sending traces from device to tool</li>
	<li>Activating traces from tool</li>
	<li>Standardized AND custom trace formats</li>
	<li>Decoding and analyzing of traces in tools</li>
	<li>Recording traces in log files</li>
</ul>
