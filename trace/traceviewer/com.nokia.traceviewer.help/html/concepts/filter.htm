<h2>Rules and filtering</h2>
<p>In order to manipulate the generated trace data, you can specify various 
types of rules and filters, depending on what you want to find out.</p>
<p>Usually, the criteria for the rules is defined to match the trace with 
any of the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a certain component ID</li>
	<li>a component from a certain group</li>
	<li>a pre-defined text string.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can specify the following types of rules in TraceViewer:
<ul>
<li><b>Color:</b> identifies traces that meet the specific criteria with a
certain color.</li>
<li><b>Line count:</b> counts the number of occurrences for a certain type
of trace (for example, used to indicate how many times a function has been
called during a test case).</li>
<li><b>Variable tracing:</b> shows the values of certain variables and the
history of their occurrences.</li>
<li><b>Filter:</b> filters specific traces by allowing the creation of complex
statements, which include certain traces and exclude others.</li>
<li><b>Trigger:</b> used for setting up start and stop triggers that define
specifically when traces should be received. </li>
</ul>

</p><p><b>Note:</b> Compared to trace <i>activation</i>, filters are not as 
strict about the type of data they pass on from the device.
