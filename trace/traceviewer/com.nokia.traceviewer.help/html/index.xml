	<!-- INDEX INSTRUCTIONS
	
	Use the index.xml file to define the index entries for the plugin's 
	help contents. In Eclipse 3.2 and beyond an Index tab appears in the Help
	viewer making it possible for user to more easily locate subjects of
	interest to them.
		
	In brief, every file used in the help documentation should have at least one
	associated index entry for it. Ideally, it's simple to make two entries per
	page by simply re-wording the subject slightly. For example, a view could
	be indexed twice like this, 1) Breakpoint view, and 2) Views/Breakpoint.
