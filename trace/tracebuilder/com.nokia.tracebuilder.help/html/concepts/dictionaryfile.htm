<h2>Dictionary file</h2>
<p>Dictionary files are XML files that are usually available in your development 
environment. They are automatically re-generated every time Trace Compiler is run. 
This usually happens when you compile a component that contains Open System Trace 
(OST) traces. Dictionary files can normally be found from the <i>\epoc32\ost_dictionaries</i> 
directory under your Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>
<p>In Carbide.c++, the dictionary files are loaded to the TraceViewer application. 
Traces can then be activated and decoded. For more information, see TraceViewer's Online
Help under <b>Help > Help Contents > Carbide Tools > TraceViewer</b>.</p>
