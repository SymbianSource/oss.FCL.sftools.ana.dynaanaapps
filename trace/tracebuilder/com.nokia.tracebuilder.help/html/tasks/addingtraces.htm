<h2>Adding traces to the source code</h2>
<p>To add a new trace, do the following: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Place the cursor in your source code where you want to add the trace.</li>
	<li>Click the TraceBuilder menu and select <b>Add New Trace</b>.</li>
	<li>In the <b>Add Trace</b> dialog, enter trace group, name, and text:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Trace Group</b>: the trace group is needed when you want to activate 
			your traces from the device. There are some predefined groups which you 
			can use if your trace fits the purpose. You can also define your own group 
			just by typing to the field.</li>
		<li><b>Trace Name</b>: the trace name is needed for creating unique identifiers 
			for each OST trace so that they can be identified in the PC side. 
			The trace name must be unique.</li>
		<li><b>Trace Text</b>: enter here the string you want to see when you receive 
			the trace in TraceViewer.</li>
		<li>(Optional) From the <b>Templates</b> list, you can select pre-defined
			format for the trace name and trace text.
			<p>For example, <i>Function entry-exit</i> template parses the name of the 
			class and function where the cursor is currently located. An entry trace is 
			added to the beginning of the function and the exit trace is added to the end.</p></li>
	</ul>

	</li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b>. You should get this kind of line to your source code:<br><br>
		<img src="images/ost_code.png"></li>
</ol>

<p>The trace is added to the defined location in the code, and details
such as the trace group are displayed in TraceBuilder's tree view. </p>
