 * Interface implemented by trace model extensions that need to store themselves

 * is left to the implementation. When loading, the trace provider calls
 * TraceObjectFactory.createExtension with the storage name. The object factory
 * returns an instance of this interface and the provider calls setData to
 * initialize this.
