<body><h2>TraceAnalyser overview</h2> <p>TraceAnalyser is a tool that enables
you to supervise the target application's time consumption during an operation,
or supervise parameters in Open System Trace (OST) traces. </p><p>With this
tool, you can create a set of rules that define: </p><ul>
<li>the order and maximum delay between two operations that are traced (see
example scenario below). </li>
<li>a desired range for parameter values (for example, <i>"The first parameter
of Trace A should be at least 150"</i>). </li>
</ul><p>TraceAnalyser lists both passed and failed events to the main view,
along with other information such as the pass rate. See the following example: 
</p><p><img src="images\dg_mainview.png" alt="Sample view of data filled in on the tabbed view."></p><p>
If a rule fails (for example, the interval between operations is longer than
defined), you can view more information about the violation on the <b>Fail
Log</b> tab.</p><p>You can also view history graphs of the defined rules,
to see how the performance of your application has changed over time. </p><h3><a
name="case1"></a>Example: Analysing timings in a camera application</h3><p>
When developing a camera application, you might want to define the following
kind of rule: </p><p><i>&ldquo;Taking a picture should not take longer than
5 seconds.&rdquo;</i></p><p>To monitor this programmatically, you can instrument
your code so that OST trace is placed to capture the key press for taking
a picture, and another where the taken picture is shown to the user. The corresponding
rule would then state that these actions must occur within 5 seconds. </p><h5>
