<body><h2>Viewing the rule history</h2> <p>The rule <b>Graph</b> tab shows all detected
rule events for one rule. In this view, you can inspect how the
performance of your application has evolved over time. </p>
<p>To view the graph: </p><ul>
<li>On the main view, right-click a rule and select <b>Draw History</b> from the context menu. <p>
A graphical illustration of the performance of the rule is shown at different
times. </p></li>
<li><p>You can see the exact timestamp and values at any time by placing the
cursor on the line. See the example below: </p><p><img src="images\tab_Graph.png"
alt="Sample of the history graph showing the timestamp and values."></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This view helps you track down reasons for your application's performance problems. 
From the graph, you can see when the performance of the application
has deteriorated significantly. The graph is updated in real time, meaning
that if it is open while the corresponding rule event is received, the graph is
updated immediately.</p> <h5>Related tasks</h5><ul>
