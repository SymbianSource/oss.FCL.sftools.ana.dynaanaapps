<body><h2>Configuring tracing rules with TraceAnalyser</h2> <p>TraceAnalyser
is a tool that enables you to supervise and analyse the target application's
time consumption during an operation, or supervise parameters in Open System
Trace (OST) traces. </p><p>With this tool, you can create a set of rules that
define the order and maximum delay between two traces, or a value range that
must be met. Whenever some rule fails (for example, an operation takes longer
than what was required in the rule), a failure log is written to TraceAnalyser's
interface. You can also view history graphs of the defined rules. </p><p>
