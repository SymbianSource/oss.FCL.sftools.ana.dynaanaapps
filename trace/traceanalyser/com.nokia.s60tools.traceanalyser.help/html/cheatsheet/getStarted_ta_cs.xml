<cheatsheet title="Configuring tracing rules to analyse application's performance">
<intro> 
<description>This tutorial shows you the steps for creating tracing rules in the TraceAnalyser tool.
<br/><br/>
<b>Prerequisites</b>
<br/><br/>
* TraceViewer and TraceBuilder applications are present in your Carbide.c++ environment.
<br/><br/>
* (Optional) TraceSwitch SIS is installed on your device.
<br/><br/>
You can obtain TraceSwitch from the S60 RnD SDK, under the <b>RnD Tools</b> folder. TraceSwitch, together with the ToolsStarter SIS, support the USB connection method by default. You only need to plug in the device to start receiving traces.

<description>Adding Open System Traces (OST) means adding &quot;tags&quot; to your application&apos;s source code, to those places that you want to monitor. 
<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to do this is by using the TraceBuilder application: <b>Carbide &gt; TraceBuilder</b>. 
<br/>
<br/>
For example, to monitor timings in a camera application, you could add the first trace to capture the key press for taking a picture, and another where the taken picture is shown to the user. 
<br/>
<br/>
The corresponding rule to be created in TraceAnalyser might then state that these actions must occur within 5 seconds.

      <description>
         To use Open System Trace (OST) traces, you must include the &quot;OpenSystemTrace.h&quot; header file from the development environment.

         title="Obtain the files generated in the compilation.">
      <description>
         After compiling your project, you should have two files: 
<br/><br/>
1: A SIS file of your application that you can install into the device by using USB. 
<br/><br/>
2: An XML format dictionary file that is needed for activating and decoding traces in TraceViewer. 
<br/><br/>
The file is generated into the following directory: 
<br/><br/>
[SDK root]\epoc32\include\internal\symbiantraces\dictionary.

         title="Define connection settings.">
      <description>
         To start receiving traces on the TraceViewer application, define connection settings between the device and your PC. 
<br/><br/>
Start the TraceViewer tool from <b>Carbide &gt; TraceViewer</b>.
<br/><br/>
On the toolbar, click the small arrow and from the drop-down list, select <b>Connection Settings</b>.

         title="Activate and decode traces.">
      <description>
         Trace activation is a way of generating specific trace data that is relevant for your components. This reduces the amount of traces listed on the TraceViewer user interface. 
<br/><br/>
Start the TraceViewer tool from <b>Carbide &gt; TraceViewer</b>.
<br/><br/>
Load the dictionary file (.xml) that contains the necessary component and group information. 
<br/><br/>
Activate the components and groups you want to use. 
<br/><br/>
For more information, see TraceViewer Help.

      <description>
         Start TraceAnalyser from <b>Carbide &gt; TraceAnalyser</b>. 
<br/><br/>
Create either <b>Timing</b> or <b>Parameter</b> rule type for the events you want to monitor.
<br/><br/>
An example of the rule could be a statement like this: &quot;Taking a picture should not take longer than 5 seconds.&quot;

         In TraceViewer, start receiving traces. 
<br/><br/>
Run the SIS file of your application on the device.

         title="Analyse the rules in TraceAnalyser and TraceViewer.">
      <description>
         All executed trace rules (both passed and failed ones) are listed on the TraceAnalyser main view. 
<br/><br/>
If some of them fail during execution (for example, an operation execution takes longer than defined in the rule), the TraceAnalyser icon will quickly flash to indicate that a rule violation has occurred.
<br/><br/>
To view the failed cases, select the <b>Fail Log</b> tab. 
<br/><br/>
To view the traces that caused the failure,  double-click a rule on the view. TraceViewer opens and scrolls to the traces. 
<br/><br/>
Double-click the trace to jump to the codeline that caused the failure.

   To view the traces that caused the failure,  double-click a rule on the TraceAnalyser <b>Fail Log</b>. 
<br/><br/>
TraceViewer opens and scrolls to the trace. 
<br/><br/>
In TraceViewer, double-click the trace to jump to the codeline that caused the failure.
<br/><br/>
Once you have identified the problem in the source code, try to fix it and run the rule again.
